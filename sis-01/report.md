# SIS #01 — Software Engineering Fundamentals, With an AI in the Loop

<!--
  This is the only file you write your report in. README.md tells you what goes where.

  Rules the checker relies on:
  - Do not delete, rename or renumber the ## headings, the ### headings, or the **Label:** words.
  - Replace every "(write here)" and "(paste here)". None may be left when you submit.
  - Comments like this one are ignored by the word counter. Delete them or leave them.

**Topic:** 1.6

<!-- Exactly one of 1.1 … 1.10, e.g.  **Topic:** 1.4  -->

## 1. Scenario

<!-- 100–150 words, labels included. One small scenario, used in every prompt and in your
     whole answer. Anything fictional is labelled in Assumptions. -->

**Question:** How can fundamental software engineering principles help create a reliable and user-friendly university study room booking system?

**Users:** University students who need rooms for studying and administrators who manage room availability.

**Problem:** In this fictional scenario, students must contact university staff to reserve study rooms. This manual process wastes time, creates confusion, and may cause booking conflicts.

**Constraints:**
1. Each room booking must not exceed two hours.
2. The system must prevent overlapping active bookings for the same room.

**Risk:** A software error could allow two students to book the same room at the same time, causing conflicts and reducing trust in the system.

**Assumptions:** The university, booking problems, users, and development team in this scenario are fictional. We assume the university provides a web application where students can view available rooms, make reservations, and cancel bookings.

## 2. Analysis

<!-- 350–400 words. Your answer to the question, the trade-offs, and how it applies to your
     scenario. Explain at least two engineering decisions and why they fit the scenario. -->

(write here)

## 3. Review

<!-- 250–300 words. What Prompt B's critique said and what you did with it; your two source
     checks and your two substantive revisions, each with a reason. Point at the rows of the
     tables in section 9 ("verification row 2", "change-log row 1"). -->

## 4. Conclusion

<!-- 100–150 words. Your recommendation for the scenario and its main limitation. -->

(write here)

## 5. Reflection

<!-- 150–200 words. NOT part of the main total. Written by you, not by the assistant:
     what helped, what you changed, what you learned. Specific beats flattering. -->

## 6. References

<!-- Full references, one per line, each starting with "- ". Only sources you actually opened.
     Every URL used in the verification table must also appear here. Example:

## 7. Appendix A — Initial outline

<!-- Written BEFORE you run Prompt A. Five points, your own words, numbered. These are the
     "five points" you paste into Prompt A. -->

1. Requirements: We can identify students' requirements by asking them questions and collecting their feedback. We need to understand how they want to check room availability, book rooms, and cancel bookings.

2. Dependability: We should check existing bookings before allowing a new reservation. This will prevent two students from booking the same room at the same time.

3. Development Process: First, we collect requirements and design the system. Then, we write the code, test the system, and fix any problems.

4. Software Reuse: We can use existing Python libraries to save time and reduce errors. This helps us develop the system faster without writing everything from scratch.

5. Testing: We should test the system with different situations, such as overlapping bookings, blocked rooms, and invalid booking times. We also check that valid bookings are accepted and invalid bookings are rejected.

## 8. Appendix B — AI exchanges

<!-- Complete prompts and complete responses, as text — never screenshots. Paste each inside
     the fenced block that follows its label. If a response itself contains ``` lines, open
     and close that block with ~~~~ instead. You may add B4, B5 … after B3 if you ran more. -->

## 9. Appendix C — Evidence tables

### Verification table

<!-- At least two complete rows. Source and locator: title + page / slide / section / chapter,
     or title + URL + access date (YYYY-MM-DD). Decision: keep, qualify or reject — one word. -->

| AI claim | Source and locator | Evidence found | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

### Change log

<!-- At least two substantive revisions. Your final version must differ from the AI wording,
     and the reason must say which evidence or scenario constraint made you change it. -->
